Periods of mechanization and automation have been happening since early human civilization. The prediction, by industrialists, politicians, and academics, is this period of automation will be far more disruptive and destructive than any prior period of mechanization or automation. Focusing on American employment and industry, some of the most common jobs, such as truck driving, are said to be almost entirely automated in the next 10 to 20 years. How different are the conditions in this period of automation from previous periods. Is the technological leap we are about to go through as dramatic as prior leaps? Will these changes result in a net loss of jobs, requiring a new economic structure for most of the work force?

Mechanical assistance of human work \~\~has been going on\~\~ developing for centuries, since the beginning of civilization, but true automation, where machines have begun taking whole tasks, with results of their work affecting further iterations, beginning in 1930 with the introduction feedback controllers. This automation took shape most clearly on the assembly lines of Ford automotive beginning in 1947 (where they did) and (what happened.) 

Prior to modern industrialization, nearly all mechanical assistance has led to more human effort needed rather than less. As an example, the cotton gin was meant to reduce the need for slaves but instead ended up creating even more demand. (Rewrite, cite both.) Even with early automation going beyond augmenting human work to fully replacing it, employment and overall economic prosperity have increased in wealthy countries till recently. Developing countries too have seen benefits since automation makes manufacturing more portable and wealthy countries will often pay for initial upfront costs. (Cite Apple building out Indian and Vietnamese manufacturing.)
